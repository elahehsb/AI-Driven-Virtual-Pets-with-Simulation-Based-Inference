# AI-Driven-Virtual-Pets-with-Simulation-Based-Inference

### Project Overview
Imagine a virtual pet that not only interacts with users but also learns and adapts its behavior over time, just like a real pet. This project involves creating a virtual pet application that uses advanced simulation-based inference (SBI) methods to adapt its behavior based on user interactions and environmental changes. The pet's behavior will be governed by a simulator-based model, which will evolve using data from interactions with users. This project combines AI, simulation-based inference, and user interaction to create an engaging and intelligent virtual pet experience.

### Objectives
1. Design the Virtual Pet Simulator:

    Develop a simulation model for a virtual pet, including behavior patterns, health metrics, and interaction rules.
2. Implement Simulation-Based Inference:

    Apply SBI techniques to estimate and update the pet's behavior model based on user interactions and environmental factors.
3. Create an Interactive Application:

    Develop a user-friendly application where users can interact with the virtual pet and influence its behavior.
4. Optimize and Validate the Model:

    Enhance the simulation model to handle real-world data variability and validate the pet's behavior through user feedback.
5. Deploy and Gather Feedback:

    Deploy the application and gather user feedback to refine the virtual pet's behavior and improve the SBI techniques.
